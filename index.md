#### Code
Here is my code for my [robot arm](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tpc14/tpc14_rosintro/-/blob/main/ur5e_robot/scripts/planning.py) writing my initials (TPC) in 3d space.
It uses poses and cartesian motion planning in ROS.

#### Description
The problem was to write my initials (TPC) in space using the UR5eâ€™s end effector. 
My approach was to have the robot move to three unique starting locations using pose goals and once at a starting location, execute a letter using waypoints (cartesian interpolation). 
I made sure the starting locations were close enough so that the robot would not throw any errors saying that it could not find a solution. 
Another important note was to make sure that the robot would be able to reach the starting position for the letter T from the finished execution position for C so that I could debug without any issues after running the code multiple times.
